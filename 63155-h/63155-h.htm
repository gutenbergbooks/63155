  <i>A Canadian soldier, wounded at Ypres, speaks</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  So this green land is England!  Her we saw<br />
  Radiant and smiling in our early dreams,<br />
  A land by love dream-haunted.  Now we come<br />
  With stranger vision than our youth could give<br />
  To the great shelter of her mighty arms.<br />
  We come from battles bitter and long fought<br />
  To see the stars shining on village streets<br />
  And watch a country in midsummer calm&mdash;<br />
  A soft land, lying August-clad but chill,<br />
  Dull to Canadian eyes that know the sun<br />
  As it stalks red across an azure sky.<br />
  And as we limp about and smoke, play cards,<br />
  And wait impatient to be off again,<br />
  Sometimes we two, amid the comrades here,&mdash;<br />
  Two only of the three who started out,<br />
  For, in the wood at Julien, Edward fell&mdash;<br />
  Sometimes we two go silent, then look up<br />
  To see if we can find in others' eyes<br />
  A knowledge that has grown with us from out<br />
  The fields of France, when in those awful nights,<br />
  <i>Some of us heard a rumor, saw a Form.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we look back unto that strange new hour<br />
  When time was suddenly transformed for us<br />
  Within a sleepy town near old Quebec.<br />
  We, sunburned, and already turning home<br />
  From a long forest tramp of two good weeks,<br />
  We who were friends together, town and school<br />
  And lives in common, knitting us akin.<br />
  We had been tramping through the distant hills<br />
  Far out of reach of papers and of news<br />
  And when we stopped for letters, it was there<br />
  We met the first surprising note of war:<br />
  A little bill-board like a clarion voice<br />
  Shouted to us on that midsummer day,<br />
  "Germany says!"  And on and on and on<br />
  The fateful message ran.  We turned and stared<br />
  Into each other's eyes in blank amaze.<br />
  "Germany says!"  In two short weeks of time<br />
  Hidden by forests as we three had been<br />
  Could all the world be humbled so that news<br />
  Of Germany, and what she says or does<br />
  Or does not say or do, could raise the storm<br />
  Whose thunders shook us even from afar.<br />
  "Belgium is entered!"  "England is prepared!"<br />
  "Canada mobilizing!"  Oh, ye gods,<br />
  What things to read upon a little board<br />
  Tacked up above the place where letters lie!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Later, we asked for ours, and they were full<br />
  Of a new wonder and a great surprise.<br />
  My little sister wrote, "I never dreamed<br />
  That things could happen in this prosy town;<br />
  But everyone is stirring and awake.<br />
  Red Cross is starting, and each girl I know<br />
  Has sent for wool.  For we must learn to knit."<br />
  Then Edward broke his printed envelope:<br />
  "Insurance premiums for the risk in war."<br />
  The air went chill as at a sudden blast.<br />
  Nigel put his away.  Nor opened it.<br />
  His letters must be read quite out of sight.<br />
  To-day I think he did not want to read.<br />
  To-morrow he would see her.  And the word<br />
  Upon all lips would come into their eyes.<br />
  We talked with village gossips all day long,<br />
  We heard their suppositions, hopes and fears,<br />
  We tried to puzzle out those buried weeks,<br />
  When, out of sight and sound, such things had come<br />
  Upon the world we knew, that it no more<br />
  Was our same world.  And we, in forest ways<br />
  Had been quite lost while it was changing.  Strange<br />
  Past anything that we had dreamed before!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We climbed the hill behind the little town<br />
  And as we sat the gathering darkness fell,<br />
  The lights sprang up within the window panes<br />
  And some young boy had found a penny flute<br />
  Which through the gloaming sounded thin and clear<br />
  Like an emphatic fairy note, that called<br />
  To all the spirits that could hear its voice<br />
  To come and follow, follow where it led.<br />
  All here and there that shrill young flute cried "Come."<br />
  And sometimes laughter followed in its train.<br />
  We knew that children catching the refrain<br />
  Would follow, follow on all luring led<br />
  By that young voice through lands of summer night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In the first bird note of St. Julien<br />
  I heard that flute again from hills of home,<br />
  When we three sat on that strange August night<br />
  And tried to talk and felt our own words fail,<br />
  But stared through violet shadows and knew then<br />
  That worlds might fall away and new ones dawn,<br />
  But never in this world more vital hours<br />
  Could come for Canada, or for ourselves<br />
  Than these midsummer days when all the land<br />
  Must ask a vital question&mdash;and reply.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then we became new soldiers in a cause<br />
  That is as old as Christ, the crucified.<br />
  As we took drill out in the open air,<br />
  Drank the long draughts of ozone keen and bright,<br />
  Felt our whole bodies grow as if new-born,<br />
  Our minds kept pace and fed on wider thoughts.<br />
  Each man I think who was in truth a man,<br />
  Felt the old life slip from him in those days<br />
  And a new purpose take the place of self.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And so we left Valcartier, and stole out<br />
  Across the ocean&mdash;that long line of ships,<br />
  "The New Armada," trailing slowly out<br />
  Across that bridge of water to the land<br />
  Where life and death indeed had met as one.<br />
  Where life and death so closely were entwined<br />
  You could not tell where one began or ceased.<br />
  We did not talk of these things at the time<br />
  But each man, as he smoked and shuffled cards,<br />
  Or drilled his squad upon the sunny deck,<br />
  Each man was conscious through that great good time<br />
  That into life a nobler friend had come<br />
  To be denied or loved as each one chose.<br />
  A strong inevitable friend, so near<br />
  That we should touch him in the passing soon:<br />
  That young-old friend that life has long named Death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At Salisbury we lived and moved in mud.<br />
  Talked mud, felt mud, and slept in it knee-deep.<br />
  England we felt not.  Only lived the day,<br />
  And fell at night to leaden dreams of home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then France, and sudden springtime bourgeoning.<br />
  Oh, bourgeoning indeed with ardent hopes!<br />
  I cannot tell you what that change was like:<br />
  I wish that words were colours, or were notes,<br />
  Then I would go past red to violet tones<br />
  To give you back that vibrancy of air,<br />
  That selfless, sacrificing, vital mood,<br />
  That almost jocund feeling of rebound<br />
  Towards the fight for liberty and right<br />
  That animated France those first spring days.<br />
  The year was young, and in the lovely land<br />
  New life was waking ardent, eager-eyed.<br />
  The very air called welcome, and we left<br />
  Homesickness far behind.  We summoned mirth<br />
  And whistled down those roads all poplar lined.<br />
  We laughed at mud that April winds would dry,<br />
  And in that grey square Market Place at ...<br />
  Where we marched past the staff and gave salute<br />
  There was baptized a new affinity,<br />
  Young Canada with France and England blent.<br />
  I tell you hearts beat faster, hopes rode high,<br />
  The air was lighter, keener, there was joy,<br />
  Great joy in our swift entrance to the fight<br />
  That closed about us fast those April days.<br />
  I think that never in its hottest hour<br />
  Was love so lovely or life so supreme<br />
  As in the sudden days of leaf and bud,<br />
  Of bird song, and that quickening of the heart<br />
  That heralds Great Adventure to the soul.<br />
  There was the night we marched on Neuve Chapelle:<br />
  Thousands of shadows in a shadow host.<br />
  Beyond lay German legions, and that zone<br />
  Invisible, illusive, moving on<br />
  That men have called "The Front."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy your heart<br />
  Moving with other shadows all that night,<br />
  Knowing yourself not flesh at all, but one&mdash;<br />
  One pulse-beat in the world's great heart of flame.<br />
  Perhaps a whistling youth on days of sun,<br />
  One among shadows on this night of nights,<br />
  Moving with other shadows all night long.<br />
  One leaving little loves far, far behind,<br />
  One pressing on with thousands of his kind<br />
  To answer that great question life had asked<br />
  Each one upon his hilltop back at home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We three marched near together through old France,<br />
  Together trenched those days at Neuve Chapelle,<br />
  And saw the heavens part and fires descend,<br />
  And felt the roar of such a cannonade<br />
  As all the world of battles had not known.<br />
  The French lay close beside us, and near them<br />
  The lithe, brown men from India&mdash;heroes they.<br />
  We felt like children just discarding toys<br />
  In face of those whose souls had long known war,<br />
  Whose spirits flashed like rapiers in the face<br />
  Of the Great Danger.  They were men indeed<br />
  Whom it was good to look upon and know,<br />
  And in those nights they learned of us to say,<br />
  When German flares lit up the evening skies,<br />
  "Behold the Northern Lights!"  St. Julien came,<br />
  And that wild night in which old Edward fell.<br />
  Those hours are hard to speak about at all.<br />
  They went by like a flash in which we moved<br />
  As one man altogether, and the hours<br />
  Flared up to heaven like a burning torch.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nigel and I, one night just after Ypres,<br />
  Were struggling with our ancient college-French<br />
  Talking, or stumbling into talk, with one<br />
  Called René Paule, from an adjacent trench,<br />
  Who had been wounded in an early fight.<br />
  And he with eloquence and poetry<br />
  Like all his vivid race, made haste to tell<br />
  Of a strange rumor we had heard before,<br />
  How in the depths of plain unvarnished hell<br />
  Quivering with anguish so he could not move<br />
  And waiting for the stretcher-bearers' call,<br />
  He suddenly felt healing, cool and sweet,<br />
  As you might feel a fan on a hot day<br />
  Swayed by an unseen hand.  And softly then<br />
  Closing his eyes on blessed, stealing sleep<br />
  He felt a touch, and looking up beheld<br />
  The kindest, sweetest eyes in all the world.<br />
  It was a Comrade in the khaki brown,<br />
  His face was tired, but the eyes were keen<br />
  And tender as a dewy flower at dawn.<br />
  And René, feeling once again the pain,<br />
  Grasped the hand tight, and looked into the eyes<br />
  For succor, and they held him there, serene,<br />
  And slowly, slowly conquered the strong pain.<br />
  And René saw the khaki melt away<br />
  Until the Comrade seemed all wrapt in white<br />
  As though sheer light had woven a robe for him,<br />
  And his strong eyes gleamed like an azure flame,<br />
  And he held René through the bitter night,<br />
  Until the stretcher-bearers came at dawn.<br />
  "So the White Comrade often comes, my friends,"<br />
  He said to us, and smiling, mused awhile.<br />
  "These fields are not so difficult in death;<br />
  Whether we live or die it all seems one.<br />
  He has come back to us because we die<br />
  As He did, long ago, for love of man."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Often we talked of Edward, and he seemed<br />
  To march beside us down the bright French roads.<br />
  We moved into the firing line once more.<br />
  So close the German lines, there only lay<br />
  An orchard, in the loveliness of May,<br />
  Between us and the armies of the Huns.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes I think that Festubert will hold<br />
  Rank equal with St. Julien, for those<br />
  Who lived through its abandonment of fire.<br />
  It was the Gunners' day.  We had to shell<br />
  Those trenches that were fortresses indeed,<br />
  And pouring hell's own native thunder out.<br />
  The orchard lay between us, and it seemed<br />
  We simply had to take that place by storm.<br />
  They tried to ditch us with their hedge of wire;<br />
  We plunged and made for gaps, and all the while<br />
  They rained on us artillery fire, until<br />
  Ear drums were stilled and nerves quite ceased to work;<br />
  Machine gun, shrapnel, rifle-fire as one<br />
  Kept up the deadly dance of death.  And we<br />
  Dashed at them, through that dance, till hand to hand<br />
  We cleared our orchard, or they say we did.<br />
  It was the Gunners' Day.  I know that much.<br />
  Some of the fun I missed, for at the height,<br />
  Just when is lost completely every thought<br />
  Of one's own entity, or reason why<br />
  It is not, after all, good sport to die<br />
  In such a whirlwind of emotion,&mdash;then,<br />
  Out of a little puff of air it came,<br />
  The one shot meant for me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell inert<br />
  And sank into unconsciousness, till one<br />
  Dragging me off made torture of my wound,<br />
  Then left me under some small spreading shrubs.<br />
  Surely one needed shelter from the sun<br />
  And hottest air that ever poured on pain.<br />
  I longed for water, looked for human aid,<br />
  But no one came.  Only the roar of guns<br />
  And a far distant sound that meant the play<br />
  Of men in action, that and drilling pain<br />
  Met in a hideous duet of war.<br />
  I called to Nigel with my aching mind<br />
  And knew it was in vain.  Again I called<br />
  To youth, and to some Force in other worlds<br />
  That might put me to death or ease my pain.<br />
  A thousand swords were running through my brain,<br />
  The blood thumped like an engine in my head.<br />
  If I should faint the Comrade White might come!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only in dreams, in dying dreams of pain<br />
  He comes, I thought.  Or else it is quite vain<br />
  To trust such fairy tales as René told.<br />
  Oh, for a glass of water!  It was noon<br />
  And o'er the grassy plain the sleepy hum<br />
  Of insects, moving in a drowsy swoon,<br />
  Sang to me through my pain, as if they were<br />
  A near vibration of the guns of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "War, war, O hot and hideous and hard,<br />
  The ways you lead, the deaths you make one die!<br />
  I have died fifty times this noon!"  So ran<br />
  The anguished brain within me, on and on,<br />
  All the long way of quivering mortal woe.<br />
  The world was gone.  I, swooning, felt it go,<br />
  Was at the point of nothingness, when there,<br />
  Moving across the grass on hands and knees,<br />
  I saw a brown-clad figure crawling slow<br />
  As if he were a part of the hot plain,<br />
  And wondered if I'd last until he came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Never that troop of angels in the air<br />
  At Mons showed brighter wings or lovelier light<br />
  Than the worn khaki of that Comrade dear.<br />
  I felt him bind my wounds with tender touch,<br />
  And at his touch the ghosts of pain escaped.<br />
  I saw him smile above me, and I swooned<br />
  For joy of waking up not all alone.<br />
  I begged "Stay with me till they come!" and then<br />
  Looked up into his face for the first time<br />
  And saw it was old Edward who had died<br />
  At Julien.  We left him lying there<br />
  White in the moonlight as we all rushed on.<br />
  We buried him, Edward the loved and brave,<br />
  And now I stared through pain and saw his face.<br />
  I saw his eyes, shining and lit with love:<br />
  The old eyes, staunch and loyal as they were<br />
  All through our youth together, and these days<br />
  Of the great camaraderie of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Edward," I murmured, and he only smiled<br />
  And waved across the grass right at the guns<br />
  Whose thunder sounded fainter in my ears.<br />
  "How did you come?" I asked him, as I held<br />
  Tight to his hand, that big brown hand of his.<br />
  Oh, it was good to die and have him back!<br />
  For I had died.  That was quite clear to me.<br />
  He only said, "The pain will go, old chap!"<br />
  Just the same voice, with the accustomed burr<br />
  Of his Scotch father sounding through its tones.<br />
  And we sat silent in the burning noon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then in the distance two small figures moved,<br />
  A third behind them, and I knew the boys<br />
  Bearing the stretchers were quite close at hand,<br />
  And Edward waved them so they came on fast.<br />
  To have him leave me!  That were a new death<br />
  And something told me that he could not stay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I long to die, just now, before they come!"<br />
  This I told Edward with what strength I had.<br />
  And he laughed softly, and I held his hand,<br />
  Looked at him long, until the blinding noon<br />
  Came to bend down between us, and his face,<br />
  Tender and brown and kindly, seemed enwrapt<br />
  In a white light, mysterious and strong,<br />
  Turning the khaki silver.  And the hand<br />
  Holding me fast was part of the great light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I closed my eyes.  And now the boys had come,<br />
  Lifted me up, taken me quite away<br />
  To a camp hospital where Nigel lay<br />
  Wounded as I was, out of all vain hope<br />
  Of further fighting for a long half year.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The stretcher-bearers story?  It was this:<br />
  That a strange glow had rested on the shrubs<br />
  'Neath which I lay&mdash;just a broad patch of light<br />
  To show there was a human being there<br />
  In need of human aid.  And so they came.<br />
  "You were half gone, my friend," they said to me,<br />
  "It was a wonder that we saw you there!<br />
  Strange that the sun so centred on that spot!"<br />
  And Nigel, when I told him, said "I think<br />
  You were mistaken, but I dare not say<br />
  What is revealed to any man these days.<br />
  You know the angels that appeared at Mons!<br />
  Many have seen bright angels on the field.<br />
  I have not seen, but then my eyes are dim,<br />
  My vision turns back home so constantly.<br />
  If I were dying I should think of her,<br />
  She is my Christ, my angel and my hope.<br />
  Before each battle I make prayers to her,<br />
  And so the earthly love is still my goal.<br />
  There are two Comrades, Love and Loneliness,<br />
  Perhaps Christ enters when we touch the last.<br />
  Loneliness waiteth long, until we give<br />
  The last glad hold we have on life, and I&mdash;<br />
  I have not given yet my hold on life."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now in this green England that we saw<br />
  Radiant and smiling in our early dreams,<br />
  We two are marking time, looking at hills<br />
  And these small village streets, and playing cards<br />
  And telling yarns, and idling in the sun.<br />
  And as we limp about and wait, sing songs,<br />
  Exchange the tales of trench and hot assault<br />
  And hear again the whistling shrapnel call,<br />
  Muse in the firelight, laugh at old alarms,<br />
  And wait impatient to be off again,<br />
  Sometimes we two, amid the comrades here,<br />
  Sometimes we two go silent.  Then look up<br />
  To see if we can find in others' eyes<br />
  A knowledge that has grown with us from out<br />
  The fields of France, when in those awful nights<br />
  <i>Some of us heard a rumor, saw a Form.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

<p class="poem">
  And so, my friends, this word I bring to you<br />
  Hot from the hell of conflict whence I come,<br />
  Where life and death, binding men's spirits close,<br />
  Have sealed a certain knowledge on our souls.<br />
  Christ has come back to earth in these great days,<br />
  I, but a young Canadian, tell you this.<br />
  The stories of our battles,&mdash;Neuve Chapelle,<br />
  St. Julien, Festubert, and all the rest&mdash;<br />
  They have been told already scores of times,<br />
  Sung, written, painted, burned in words of flame.<br />
  My words are homely as a tallow dip,<br />
  As crude as that, but just as stoutly true.<br />
  Christ has come back to earth in these great days,<br />
  He has come back, as in the centuries past<br />
  He suddenly appeared upon the streets<br />
  Of old Judean towns.  Let people talk<br />
  Of ancient creeds and dogmas as they will,<br />
  That helps not, hinders not, the vital truth<br />
  That one young man in his most ardent youth<br />
  So loved life, felt life, understood its laws,<br />
  So took pain to his heart, so took great love,<br />
  And knew that pain and love are always one,<br />
  And knew that death can be lived through to life,<br />
  Till he commanded death, and death obeyed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So comes the Comrade White, down silent pain.<br />
  He comes to woods and battlefields to-day,<br />
  (Sometimes I think he loves the woods the best)<br />
  And finds free souls flung skyward, glad to go.<br />
  Among the lonely and the pain-racked ones<br />
  He comes&mdash;not death at all, but radiant life,<br />
  Comes in the eyes of comrades, lives in hearts<br />
  That give all, taking nothing in return.<br />
  He is a rumor and a far white light,<br />
  He is the singing bird, the children's flute<br />
  That called us wooing forth to give our all.<br />
  The floating glad things of the buoyant air,<br />
  Young earth's warm children, music and delight,<br />
  Live in His eyes: those deathless azure eyes,<br />
  That smile upon the moment we thought hard,<br />
  And turn our sacrifice to kindling light.<br />
  <i>They pass through radiant gates on whom He smiles.</i><br />

  THE AWAKENING
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  How like a giant stretching in the sun,<br />
  We have slept through the ages; even we<br />
  Whom the gods moulded for a people free,<br />
  And made tremendous for the race not run.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  See we have slept a magic cycle round,<br />
  And in the dream we have imagined much;<br />
  Felt the soft wings of years we did not touch,<br />
  Dallied with somnolence that deadens sound.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With untried strength what we have done is done.<br />
  The wandering, drowsy brain has vaguely stirred,<br />
  As though from out infinitude it heard<br />
  A great voice speaking from behind the sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Closer and clear the calling, strangely loud,<br />
  And the great country, rousing from long sleep<br />
  Murmurs to its own soul, as deep to deep<br />
  Beckons a day's new dawn, so sure and proud.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These were the visions of a passing night,<br />
  Visions now caught in bugle notes of flame,<br />
  <i>And lo, through storms of war we hear our name<br />
  Called by an angel, terrible and bright.</i><br />
</p>

  THE HEARTS OF MOTHERS<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The hearts of mothers are hid things<br />
  In these the days of woe,<br />
  And troops of strange thoughts move therein<br />
  Silently to and fro.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They are not thoughts of yester-year,<br />
  Or thoughts of you and me<br />
  And that which we have done, or do,<br />
  By air, or land, or sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But these are thoughts steel-bright with pain,<br />
  And death-thoughts bare and stark,<br />
  And shining thoughts of armaments<br />
  That glitter through the dark.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They move, old passions and revolts,<br />
  Fresh-called, yet stiff with scars,<br />
  To music crimsoned with the clash<br />
  Of endless ancient wars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And those who summon memories<br />
  From pathways of the sun,<br />
  When death spoke life most solemnly<br />
  Ere new life was begun,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They dream of a strange blooming<br />
  That dawns in greater birth:<br />
  The frail, bright flower of selflessness<br />
  Brought back again to earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They feel, the Givers of all Life,<br />
  Great need to give again<br />
  The utmost dower of womanhood,<br />
  All mystery&mdash;all pain.<br />

  SOUL OF THE EARTH<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I saw a tired soldier vainly searching<br />
  For room to bury deeply the new dead.<br />
  "The old dead they are there, forever perching<br />
  About the space we need," he grimly said.<br />
  "The old dead, slaughtered, just beneath the sod<br />
  Of Earth that once was well-beloved of God."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard a woman desperate in her wooing<br />
  Of empty space and echoing aisles of air,<br />
  Calling upon the gods of her undoing<br />
  To stem the fearful flood of her despair.<br />
  "Somewhere in France he lies so deep," she said.<br />
  "That Earth must make me answer for my dead."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And all the while a wondrous bloom was springing<br />
  Above the fields where lie these broken boys,<br />
  Thousands of souls like butterflies upwinging<br />
  In troop on radiant troop of shining joys.<br />
  Host upon host they seek eternal breath<br />
  Above the little mounds of lonely death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thus," saith the Earth, "my poppies pass in splendor,<br />
  Flame of young hearts, for still my world is young,<br />
  And in great Ages, wise because more tender,<br />
  The passion of their passing shall be sung.<br />
  Ask of these Ages!  For the soul of me<br />
  Knows endless blooming&mdash;vivid, changing, free."<br />

  I USED TO WEAR A GOWN OF GREEN<br />

<p class="poem">
  I used to wear a gown of green<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing a song to May,<br />
  When apple blossoms starred the stream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Spring came up the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I used to run along with Love<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By lanes the world forgets,<br />
  To find in an enchanted wood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first frail violets.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And ever 'mid the fairy blooms<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmur of the stream,<br />
  We used to hear the pipes of Pan<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call softly through our dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now, in outcry vast, that tune<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fades like some little star<br />
  Lost in an anguished judgment day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarlet flames of war.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What can it mean that Spring returns<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purple violets bloom,<br />
  Save that some gypsy flower may stray<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside his nameless tomb!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To pagan Earth her gown of green,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her elfin song to May&mdash;<br />
  <i>With all my soul I must go on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the scarlet day.</i><br />

"We watched the boys march singing through the streets of
Kingston.  We cheered to them and waved to them as the train
pulled out."  CONINGSBY DAWSON, in "<i>The Passing of the 34th.</i>"

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  How you passed out singing on that winter day!<br />
  All the air was ringing with your laughter gay;<br />
  With the song and banter that made light the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There were few sighs wasted on dividing years,<br />
  There was mirth and music, kisses, hopes and fears,<br />
  Cigarettes and banners, chocolates, socks and tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Swifter than your passing did the fancy run,<br />
  Soldiers, horses, bayonets&mdash;how you all seemed one,<br />
  Flashing through the snowflakes and the veiled sun;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Every woman cheered you, some few women wept,<br />
  Graybeards longed to join you, peaceful babies slept;<br />
  But the land that bore you her own counsel kept.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only, through the snowflakes sped a rift of light,<br />
  Keen as pointed sword-blade and intensely bright&mdash;<br />
  Like the Lord's hand resting on the ranks of right.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And our hearts would send you, as a song of spring,<br />
  Unforgotten echoes of the songs you sing,<br />
  And the hope and courage that the new days bring.<br />
</p>

  Here's our love and greeting from the old home town;<br />
  Here's to speedy meeting, and to your renown;<br />
